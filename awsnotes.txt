----------->S3(simple storage service)<------------
install awscli on local machine(windows) msi
1.in order to connect to s3 firstly we should have access and secrete access keys .
2.configure the access and secrete access keys
 aws configure enter access and secrete access keys
3.to see the list of bucketsin s3 
 aws s3 ls
4. to see the objects inside the bucket 950281
 aws s3 ls s3://950281
5.to cp from instance to s3 bucket
 aws s3 cp source s3://bucketname
6. to copy from s3 to instance
 aws s3 cp s3://9502816/passwd .
7.in linux machine awscli need to be installed
 when downloading or uploading the files from s3 to instance or instance to s3 
 related to any error having region code you need to specify the region code as                                                                         well
8.using region code how to download and upload from bucket
 aws s3 cp s3://bucketname/filename destination --region us-east-1
 aws s3 cp sourcefilename s3://bucketname --region regioncode
9.your access and secrete access keys are stored in a file called
  .aws/config
10.in .aws/config we need to mention the default region code as us-east-1
11.[default]
   region=us-east-a
12.in s3 only one file can be uploaded and text file can be viewed
13.text file ending eith .txt 
14.file permissions are mandatory for requirement chmod ugo=rx filename
15.
--------------->EFS(elastic file system<----------------------------------
1.create a efs and mention the vpc and also the az's
2.install two instances and attach default security group to it
3.create a ssh connection b/w the servers
4.in instance1 create a directory 
5.install nfs-common on both the servers
6.mount the instance1 with directory created on instance one
7.create directory in instance2
8.mount the directory present in the instance2 with it
9.now we can see the file sharing is happening
         ---------><------------------
-------------------->EBS(elastic block storage<-------------
1.we can able to install os and softwares in it
2.Generally it is having 5 types gp2,iops,sc,st,magnetic
3.out of these 5 only 3 are used for installation 0f softwares gp2,iops,magnetic
4.we can create an volume and delete an volume
5.we can mount to instance after creating an volume 
6.create directory siva
7.mount /dev/xvdf siva
8.create a file system into it 
  mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
9.to see the mounting happened
  lsblk  list of blocks
10. to see the file system is there are not
  blkid  blockid if we create again create a file system we may loose previous data
11.to unmount the volume
  umount /dev/vdf
12.to attach a volume to the ec2 instance volume and instance to be present in the 
   same az's
13.from volume we can create snapshot
14.from snapshot we can create the in any region or az and can attach to instances
15.snapshots are stored in s3
16.snapshot can't be attched diretly to ec2 instance
17.while converting from snapshot to volume we can change the type of ebs to any  one of 5 types and we can increase the size of the volume but cant be decreased.
18.while convertion snapshot to volume we can select the az and we can attach to 
  particular instance present in the region
19.while convertion we can copy the snapshot to any other region and convert to   volume and again same repition of the work
20.s3 bucker can be accessed through cmd also by configure the aws
  aws configure
  access keyid  like username
  secrete access key like password
21.s3 is having CRR cross refion replication
    files present in the one bucket can also be shred to other bucket
   the requisite is buckets should be in different region and version controlling       to be enabled on them
22.s3 is having life cycle rules means 
   we can specify the rules from standard to standard-IA min 30days are needed
   from standard-IA to glacier min 30 days are needed
    Among all the types in s3 Glacier is the cheaper one 
23.If we want to access the files from outside from browser
   we need to give bucket permissions while bucket is creating and file permissions    to visible to all
   each file has unique url
   same file with multiple versions also have unique url
24.

















-------------->difference b/w ebs efs s3<-------------------
  EBS                       |                   efs            |s3
1.we can install os and sof  1.generally used for file sharing  1.used for storing
                     twares                                                objects
2.storage size is limited    2.unlimited storage                2.unlimited storage
3.very costly                3.less cost compaewd to ebs        3.among 3 s3 cheap
4.we can't attach ebs to     4.we can attach efs to multiple
multiple instances at a time    instances at a time             4.global service
5.5 types                     5.only one type                   5.4 types
 gp2                                                       standard(4 9's,11 '9s)

 sc                                                        rr (same as above)
  st                                                       glacier(a=nil,d=11 9's)
 magnetic                                                In s3 snapshots are stored
